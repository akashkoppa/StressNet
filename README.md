Description: A version of StressNet for tall and short vegetation has been combined with a process-based model - Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) - to create a hybrid model of global terrestrial evaporation. The resulting deep learning formulations and the hybrid model are detailed in the preprint. The manuscript is currently under review.
